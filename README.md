# Model details
Model Algorithm: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
The model was trained on a filtered subset of the MovieLens dataset

Model performance was evaluated using RMSE metrics, and test user feedback
The reason behind using the collaborative filtering NMF algo was the lack of dimensions in the dataset
NMF finds user patterns and assigns them to a latent feature "n_components" 
this works well with the kind of dataset we have, and has proven to be a great recommendation algorithm after doing some research
for example, Netflix and spotifys daily mix uses a similar approach.
Recommendations are generated by predicting movie scores for a user and ranking them.
if a single title is passed, a matrix is created with all zeros except for the movieId passed, this is then used to generate recommendations


# Pre-processing Steps
Filtering users by activity level,
Selecting diverse users to reduce popularity bias,
Filtering movies by popularity,
Z-score normalization of user ratings, mainly to tackle users with extreme ratings, this proved to a better any other normalization method tested


# Model Performance
The model has been tested with several user profiles, with generally positive feedback. See the demo notebook for examples of recommendations and user feedback.

The search functionality for movie titles is basic and may not find all matches,
mainly because this isnt the intended use but i wanted to keep some easy access testing.
Recommendations may sometimes favor popular movies
